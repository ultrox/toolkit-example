* [Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
   - Sensible opinionated defaults [NO!, I don't want to configure your app](https://robotlolita.me/articles/2016/no-i-dont-want-to-configure-your-app/)
 
 
## Goal
Decrease the number of decisions the programmer has to make and eliminate the complexity

## Examples: (CoC)
 - Nextjs uses `pages` as convention
 
## Other
Successful programming environments such as Ruby on Rails are based on this concept. If you follow the established conventions.

### Using the example

1. Go to _test-app_ and run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Run one of the available commands:
  * `yarn dev` - start the development
  * `yarn build` - build and optimize assets to _dist/_ directory
